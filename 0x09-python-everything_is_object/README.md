Learning Objectivesüí°
What you should learn from this project:

Why Python programming is awesome
What is an object
What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
What is a reference
What is an assignment
What is an alias
How to know if two variables are identical
How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
What is mutable and immutable
What are the built-in mutable types
What are the built-in immutable types
How does Python pass variables to functions
0. Who am I?
What function would you use to print the type of an object?
1. Where are you?
How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?
2. Right count
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
3. Right count =
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
4. Right count =
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
5. Right count =+
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
6. Is equal
What do these 3 lines print?
7. Is the same
What do these 3 lines print?
8. Is really equal
What do these 3 lines print?
9. Is really the same
What do these 3 lines print?
10. And with a list, is it equal
What do these 3 lines print?
11. And with a list, is it the same
What do these 3 lines print?
12. And with a list, is it really equal
What do these 3 lines print?
13. And with a list, is it really the same
What do these 3 lines print?
14. List append
What does this script print?
15. List add
What does this script print?
16. Integer incrementation
What does this script print?
17. List incrementation
What does this script print?
18. List assignation
What does this script print?
19. Copy a list object
Write a function def copy_list(l): that returns a copy of a list.
20. Tuple or not?
a = ()
21. Tuple or not?
a = (1, 2)
22. Tuple or not?
a = (1)
23. Tuple or not?
a = (1, )
24. Who I am?
What does this script print?
25. Tuple or not
What does this script print?
26. Empty is not empty
What does this script print?
27. Still the same?
id(a) 139926795932424

a [1, 2, 3, 4] a = a + [5] id(a)

28. Same or not?
a [1, 2, 3]

id (a) 139926795932424 a += [4] id(a)

29. Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object!
Write a blog post about everything you just learned / this project is covering. Your blog post should be articulated this way (one paragraph per item):
30. #pythonic
Write a function magic_string() that returns a string ‚ÄúHolberton‚Äù n times the number of the iteration (see code):
31. Low memory cost
Write a class LockedClass with no class or object attribute, that prevents the user from dynamically creating new instance attributes, except if the new instance attribute is called first_name.
32. int 1/3
julien@ubuntu:/python3$ cat int.py a = 1 b = 1 julien@ubuntu:/python3$
33. int 2/3
julien@ubuntu:/python3$ cat int.py a = 1024 b = 1024 del a del b c = 1024 julien@ubuntu:/python3$
34. int 3/3
julien@twix:/tmp/so$ cat int.py print("I") print("Love") print("Python") julien@ubuntu:/tmp/so$
